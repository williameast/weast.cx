[Seed-dl](https://github.com/williameast/seed-dl) is a tool to make managing
torrent files easier when you use a seedbox. With a single command it can

- put your torrent files into the seedbox
- check if the torrent files have finished downloading
- download the files, throwing them into a directory depending on their file
  type

It is my first proper "project" and accordingly, it is still a bit bare-bones.
