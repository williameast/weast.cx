# The rundown

ever since the iPod classic came out 15? 20? years ago, I was in love with them.
Being able to carry around your entire music library on a nifty device with a
sleek user interface was amazing. Of course, with the rise of the smartphone,
iPods were slowly becoming obsolete. I kept mine around for a while though, as
phones with enough (80gb+) storage for my whole music collection were too
expensive.

When I did get my first iPhone with enough storage, I happily shelved the iPod
classic in lieu of the convenience of just having to lug one device around.
However, if my phone ran out of battery, there would be no way to listen to
music. Where my iPod had a week's worth of juice, my iPhone hardly made to
the end of the day. Also, a phone is a distraction machine - it pings and rings,
vying for your attention. Searching for the next album often sucked me into the
notification vortex.

When my phone's planned obsolescence kicked in (or I dropped it, I cant
remember), the shiny new model didn't even bother adding a headphone jack. I had
never cared much for Bluetooth, so I bit the bullet, purchased my first
"dongle" and lived with it.

the next milestone was when I downloaded Spotify. The possibility of listening
to _anything, anywhere_ was enticing. In practice though, I didn't meticulously
reproduce my music library in the app, and instead hopped from one album or
playlist to another, often letting the algorithm choose my music for me.

<!-- I talked to a few friends about this phenomenon, and the term "algorythm-core" -->
<!-- popped up. -->

<!-- - algo-core is a type of music that you believe you have ventured into sounds of -->
<!--   obscurity, but this is a learned obscurity, and everyone is following a -->
<!--   similar obscure past -->
<!--   - the youtube algo used to be amazing for finding music. it changed, and -->
<!--     people felt that. -->
<!-- - Spotify's level of operation is Albums, not songs. -->

When streaming became popular, I stopped playing my stored songs entirely. I put
away my iPod and forgot about it. Spotify was so convenient Why would I ever go
back to what was before?

# The brick wall

When the first few albums I loved were not available in spotify, I shrugged. I
would just stream them from youtube. after a while, I just stopped listening to
them alltogether. I went to spotify, plopped on a playlist, and forgot about it.
I didn't "explore" music as much as stuff was just thrown on my lap and I could
decide if I liked it or not. listening to music felt a little bit less personal,
even while the playlists were becoming more tailored to my life. Each music
session a segmented slot in an arranged calendar of my life. "study music". "Tuesday
after-coffee afternoon crash productivity mix". "running tunes". "lazy Sunday
instrumental beats", "piano for concentration". the song arrangements felt stale, mechanical, even when a few bangers
from the past would emerge out of the algorithmic swamp. I stopped listening to
music, it just became a drip feed designed to fill the void of silence. I wasn't
enjoying an album, I was consuming tracks. arrangements of songs served the
purpose of making me calmer, more productive, or loosen up, give my kitchen the
correct ambience for cooking, make me seem cultured and worldly as a
dinner-party host. It felt performative and boring. I didn't search for music, I just
waited for the autosuggestions to kick in, grunting as I clicked the sickly
green heart in the hopes of appeasing the algo.

I also missed being able to keep my own music (that I made) next to "real"
artists. I had bought some CDs off of street musicians in the past, and I liked
having them in my library. I missed my albums that were not commerically viable for spotify to
provide to me. goodbye early 90's jungle records, Joni Mitchell, adieu
Tool, King Crimson. The effort of side-loading a bunch of albums is too large for
me to care about the stragglers I'd lose by the wayside in the pursuit of
immaculate convenience.

But I noticed how my relationship to music was changing. I felt less inclined to
sit down and listen to albums. for lack of want, I would just hover around in
playlists, half human half machine. I would often get stuck in "song loops",
where the same 5 songs would constantly be played next. I felt uninspired by
music.

I still had my massive music colleciton from when I was a teenager. total
bangers like the 200 songs under the artist name "1!!!SDRUMANDBASSMIX!!!1"
ripped from 140p youtube videos, the ominous artist "mixed music", which hid IDM
and dubstep classics, all the CDs I ripped from my dad, it felt like meeting an
old friend. I wanted them back in my life, all those strange tunes I felt so
much for. Like a garden planted decades ago, I was savouring a spot in the shade
of a tree where once a sapling lay. The songs themselves remained unchanged in
their crappy quality, awful filename tagging, inconsistent formatting, but it
felt unique, this colleciton of records and snippets existed nowhere else. It's
a wonder I never lost these 100GiB of nostalgia along the way.

# Enter the iPod video

Lo an behold, the receptacle of this digital archive was mostly accessed through
the spinwheels and clicks of the iPod Classic. I wanted that experience again -
so I dug the old friend of it's dusty shelter and plugged it in. It still...
worked? it was excruciatingly slow and the battery lasted about as long piece of
toast might stay warm.

I looked into the surprisingly thriving communities of iPod restoration. storage
technology had advanced so quickly that one could gut the powerhungry and slow
Toshiba HDDs inside the iPod, and replace them with a custom SD card reader
instead. Weight, battery usage go down, storage space goes up. No firmware
updates necessary, it is literally plug and play (once you have figured out how
to open the iPod without breaking it).

I was so intrigued, I started collecting them. Consensus is that the 5th gen
80GB classics are the most sought after. Something about a superior Digital
Analog Converter, how much RAM the devices have, and how much cloud you'll have
when you pull the thing out at your local nerd convention.

Above you see the 3 iPods (5th gen, rev 1), as well as a 6th gen. the chip is
the "iFlashSolo" chipset which allows you to replace the HDD with the SD card.
As you gain a lot of space inside the enclosure, suddenly your old iPod becomes an
iconic and surprisingly hackable little device. dip your toe into the world of iPod refurbishment, you'll find all
sorts of wacky projects that people have come up with.

# and finally, Bluetooth

I opted to use the space on my iPod to add bluetooth compatibility. like all things in the 21st century, the appearance counts. From the outside,
nothing indicates that the iPod has been hacked together with a bluetooth chip.
However, in addition to plugging in your buds into the headphone jack, you could press down on the "hold" button for the iPod to
connect to your AirPods. it was far from perfect, but it was really fun. it
involved soldering the lead cables of the bluetooth device to audio jack, as
well as connecting it to the main power supply on the iPod chip. Here is what
this frankensteinian creation looks like on this inside. notice the additional
battery, the ungodly amount of load-bearing solder and the general messiness of
it.

And the button configuration involved using a clicky button from an arduino set,
a hot glue gun and a lot of patience.

But it works! I will be posting a how-to when I get round to it. Now I rock an
old iPod, and I have been using it for a while now. It feels a bit gimmicky but
it is surprisingly useful.
