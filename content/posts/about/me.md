I'm William. I am a sales operations analyst in the financial crime sector,
working for
[NICE Actimize](https://niceactimize.com), optimizing the lengthy and arduous sales cycles the
nature of the industry entails.

I completed my masters in Political Science at McGill University in Canada in
2019, and am now based in Berlin. I have worked on a couple of media projects in the
past, such as the wonderful (Wind of Change
Podcast)[https://crooked.com/podcast-series/wind-of-change/] with Patrick Keefe,
and I used to write for (Nation)[http://nationnews.ca/].

I enjoy programming, chess, electronic music and am currently building out my
workshop, where I am make silly little electronic devices that try to bring
obsolete technology into the 21st century.
